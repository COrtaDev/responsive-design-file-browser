# File Browser

Now, it's time to take your knowledge one step further. You're going to marry
your knowledge of layout with your knowledge of asynchronous programming and
data structures to interact with a server that shows you the contents of files
on your computer. From this point forward, most projects that you do will
combine all of the knowledge that you've used up to this point. The projects
will ask you to practice many skills in combination.

**The story**: This project mimics something you will experience while on the
job. There's some old version of some software running, and the users want
something newer and better. This project has you "replace" an existing software
application that browsers a file system with one that lets the users interact
better with the file system as well as improving information density and
throughput.

This project will have a tree, both visually and in memory, that stores the
representation of files and directories on your computer's hard drive in the
browser so that you can interact with it.

## The starter project

Download the starer project from
https://github.com/appacademy-starters/responsive-design-file-browser-starter.git.
It comes with a server that you will interact with from your code via `fetch`
statements.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

Go ahead and start the server by typing `npm start` in the starter project.
You'll see that the program prints out the following message.

```
Your browser.html and API served from http://localhost:3001
Browse the files statically at http://localhost:3000
```

That's right, it started _two_ Web sites. The first one is at
http://localhost:3000. Click on that link. It will open the existing version of
the file browser. It is fully functional, but basic in its presentation and
interactions.

Continuing the story, the users have clamored for something "more modern" as
well as being able to see files and directories in a tree next to the contents
and information. That's what you're going to give them!

## The starter project contents

The directory structure of the project looks like this.

```
starer/
├── directory-browsed/
├── server/
└── your-code/
    ├── icons/
    ├── browser.html
    └── style/
```

The **directory-browsed** directory is where the server will read directory
contents from. If it's in that directory, then you should be able to see it in
the application that you write. Right now, it contains a lot of files from an
open-sourced book called JavaScript Allonge, Sixth Edition, by Reg Braithwaite.
(https://github.com/raganwald/javascript-allonge-six)

The **server** directory contains the node server that powers the application
and serves your page. It starts _two_ servers:

* http://localhost:3000 - this is a built-in and rudimentary file browser that
  your application would replace
* http://localhost:3001 - this will server your code and serve your API requests
  when you `fetch` data

The **your-code** directory contains **browser.html**, the file in which you
should put your HTML. You can create all the CSS and JavaScript files you want
in the **your-code** directory and link them the way that you would normally do
it. The server will serve them for your pleasure.

The **your-code** directory also contains icons and a CSS reset file.

## The application user interface

TODO: Explain final layout

## An API overview

Your code will make calls an Application Programming Interface (API), which for
this case, is just a fancy way of saying "a place to get data from". The
following table shows the different ways that you can call the API. All URLs in
the first column will be for the server http://localhost:3001. All of the paths
are relative to the **directory-browsed** directory.

| URL                    | HTTP Verb | What it does                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| /api/path/«dir-path»   | GET       | This returns the list of files and directories in «dir-path» |
| /api/file/«file-path»  | GET       | Returns the contents of the file at «file-path»              |
| /api/entry/«file-path» | PATCH     | Moves a file from one location to another                    |

In each step of the project, it will go into depth about what you should do to
interact with those API endpoints. But, here's just a quick example.

For example, **directory-browsed** has the following entries to two levels deep.
(There are a lot more files under **javascript-allonge-six/manuscript/**.)

```
directory-browsed/
├── example.txt
└── javascript-allonge-six/
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── manuscript/
    └── need-to-be-fixed
```

Then, say you added the following HTML block to **your-browser.html**.

```html
<script>
  fetch('/api/file/javascript-allonge-six/README.md')
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(poem => console.log(poem));
</script>
```

The server would get the path `/api/file/javascript-allonge-six/README.md` as
part of your request.

The `/api/file` part is there for the server to know that you're using the API
and want it to look for a file at the path that comes after `/api/file/`.

The part that comes after `/api/file` is `/javascript-allonge-six/README.md`.
The code looks in the **directory-browsed** directory for
`/javascript-allonge-six/README.md`, finds it, and returns that content to your
code where it will get printed to the console.

Whatever path you put after `/api/path`, it's going to try to read the contents
for that file and return it to your code. If the file doesn't exist (or
something bad happens), then you code will get an appropriate HTTP status code
that indicates the error, like 404.
